# integrations
Get started with building decentralized applications and ideas with Etherparty <br><br>
Part of building an integrated deployment platform with Etherparty includes GitHub integration to make it easy to deploy code living on GitHub to apps running on Etherparty. When GitHub integration is configured for an Etherparty app, Etherparty can automatically build and release (if the build is successful) pushes to the specified GitHub repo.<br><br>
<b>Enable Git integration</b><br>
Within Etherparty you can configure GitHub integration in the Deploy tab of the Etherparty dashboard. To configure GitHub integration, you have to authenticate with GitHub thereafter you can select which repos / branches / configure auto deploys.<br>
